# Beyond the AI Plateau - Project Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive requirements, specifications, and design documentation for the Beyond the AI Plateau project launch campaign.

**Key Architecture**: The project uses a **hybrid Nx monorepo + dev container** approach that maximizes both Claude Code efficiency and Nx benefits while maintaining strategic separation for content and infrastructure.

**Content Strategy**: Leverages a separate content repository with 89% complete materials (100+ templates, 9 chapters, visual diagrams) for efficient 60-hour extraction vs 200-hour creation from scratch.

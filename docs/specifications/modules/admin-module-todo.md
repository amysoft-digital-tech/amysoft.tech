# Admin Module TODO Items

## Mock Data Endpoints - Future Implementation

The following endpoints currently return mock/placeholder data and need to be implemented with real data sources:

### Business Intelligence Controller
- **Competitive Analysis** (`/api/admin/analytics/competitive-analysis`)
  - Currently returns static competitor data
  - Needs integration with market research APIs or manual data entry system
  - Should include real market share data and competitor analysis

- **Customer Segmentation** (`/api/admin/customers/analytics/segments`)
  - Returns placeholder segmentation data
  - Needs ML-based customer segmentation algorithms
  - Should calculate segments based on actual customer behavior data

- **Conversion Funnel** (`/api/admin/analytics/conversion-funnel`)
  - Static funnel data currently
  - Needs real analytics integration (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)
  - Should track actual user journey through the platform

### Content Management
- **Categories** (`/api/admin/content/categories`)
  - Returns hardcoded categories
  - Needs proper category management system with database storage
  - Should support hierarchical categories and dynamic category creation

### Customer Administration
- **Support Ticket Integration**
  - Currently mocks support ticket data in `getSupportTickets()`
  - Needs integration with actual support system (Zendesk, Intercom, etc.)
  - Should provide real ticket history and resolution tracking

### System Health Metrics
- **Performance Monitoring** (in Business Intelligence Service)
  - Currently returns placeholder performance metrics
  - Needs integration with monitoring systems (Prometheus, New Relic, DataDog)
  - Should provide real API latency, error rates, and system health data

## Database Enhancements Needed

### New Tables to Create
1. **admin_categories** - For proper content categorization
2. **admin_sessions** - For tracking admin login sessions
3. **support_tickets** - If implementing internal support system
4. **business_metrics_cache** - For caching computed business metrics

### Indexes to Add
- Performance indexes for large-scale analytics queries
- Composite indexes for common filter combinations
- Full-text search indexes for content and customer search

## Integration Points

### External Services
- **Email Service**: For customer communication features
- **Analytics Platform**: For real conversion funnel and user behavior data
- **Support System**: For ticket management integration
- **Payment Gateway**: For enhanced revenue analytics
- **Monitoring System**: For real performance metrics

### Real-time Features
- **WebSocket Integration**: For real-time admin notifications
- **Background Jobs**: For heavy analytics computation
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for performance optimization

## Security Enhancements

### Additional Features
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: For admin accounts
- **IP Whitelisting**: For admin access restrictions
- **Session Management**: Enhanced session tracking and timeout
- **API Rate Limiting**: Per-admin user rate limiting
- **Audit Log Retention**: Configurable audit log retention policies

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Needed
- All service methods with comprehensive test coverage
- Guard functionality and permission checking
- DTO validation and transformation
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end API testing for all endpoints
- Database integration testing
- Authentication and authorization flow testing
- Performance testing under load

### Security Testing
- Permission boundary testing
- SQL injection prevention validation
- XSS protection verification
- Authentication bypass attempts

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Optimizations
- Query optimization for large datasets
- Database connection pooling
- Read replica usage for analytics queries
- Materialized views for complex reports

### Caching Strategy
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Query result caching
- Session caching
- Business metrics caching with TTL

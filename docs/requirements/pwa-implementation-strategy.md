# PWA Implementation Strategy - Requirements Specification
## Beyond the AI Plateau - Progressive Web Application

### Project Overview
- **Timeline**: 10 weeks with buffer for July 1, 2025 launch
- **Platform**: Angular 18+ with Ionic 8+, NestJS backend
- **Focus**: Tier 1 content (85% existing) for rapid value delivery
- **Architecture**: Scalable foundation for Tier 2/3 expansion post-launch

### GitHub Issues Created
- [#81](https://github.com/amysoft-digital-tech/amysoft.tech/issues/81) - PWA Foundation: Database Schema, Authentication & Basic Shell
- [#82](https://github.com/amysoft-digital-tech/amysoft.tech/issues/82) - PWA Core Content: Tier 1 Integration, Templates & Offline Capabilities
- [#83](https://github.com/amysoft-digital-tech/amysoft.tech/issues/83) - PWA Advanced Features: Tier Access Control, Progress Tracking & Assessments
- [#84](https://github.com/amysoft-digital-tech/amysoft.tech/issues/84) - PWA Enhancement: Push Notifications, Analytics & Performance Optimization
- [#85](https://github.com/amysoft-digital-tech/amysoft.tech/issues/85) - PWA Launch Preparation: QA, Security Audit & Production Deployment

### Phase Breakdown
| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **Foundation** | 2 weeks | Database schema, authentication, PWA shell |
| **Core Content** | 3 weeks | Tier 1 integration, templates, offline capabilities |
| **Advanced Features** | 2 weeks | Access control, progress tracking, assessments |
| **Enhancement** | 1.5 weeks | Push notifications, analytics, optimization |
| **Launch Prep** | 1.5 weeks | QA, security audit, deployment |

### Team Allocation
- **Frontend**: Angular/Ionic developers (1-2 per phase)
- **Backend**: NestJS developers (0.5-1 per phase)
- **QA/DevOps**: Testing and infrastructure (0.5-1 per phase)
- **Content**: Integration specialist (0.5-1 during content phases)

### Technical Success Metrics
- 99.9% uptime during launch week
- <2 second initial load time
- Zero security vulnerabilities in production
- PWA installation rate >25%

### Business Success Metrics
- 100% of Tier 1 content integrated
- Payment conversion funnel operational
- Cross-device synchronization working
- Offline reading capability verified

### Risk Mitigation Matrix
- **Foundation**: Content integration complexity, authentication delays
- **Core Content**: Template performance, offline sync complexity
- **Advanced Features**: Payment integration delays, access control bugs
- **Enhancement**: Performance optimization challenges
- **Launch Prep**: Security audit findings, deployment issues
